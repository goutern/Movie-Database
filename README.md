# cs371_backend
Backend for cs371 Movie Database

Goals:
Make a working backend that will allow me to do the following
- Configure local database connection
- Create users for storing multiple lists
- Each user can create multiple lists with titles for each list
- List available searchable databases
- Each list must be fully editable
- Must use a backend database for storage.
